#Final Project for web track CS50
##TODO list simple web app

This is a simple web app to track my todo list
I used what I learned in web track about python, sqllite, and flask beside my previus exprience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript

##features:
in this app I implemented the basic features:
- the user must be loged in to use these features
- every user has his list
- add item to list which has to basic inputs (description and category)
- categories come from database table called categories
- every user can see all his todo list in dashboard (used some sql features like JOIN)
- user can change item status
- user can delete any element (make is delete is true)
